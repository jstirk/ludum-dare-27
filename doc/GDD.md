Tiled to generate maps

Start: hacking a system. 10s to complete it. Never possible to complete. Player is shot in the head. Fade to black.

Wake up in alleyway. Drunk cursing phone. Throws phone away. You pick it up.

It's on.

Call from sponsor. Don't know how yours still alive but you'd better get set quickly. They think you're dead.

Phone isn't secure. Get to x and we'll talk more.

Go to location. Get new phone. Unlocks abilities, personalization.

Goal: expose your killers. Either hack them and expose their files. Contract a hit on them. Or do it yourself.

Sight is in radius, blocked by islanding.

Npcs move around the map. Things like CCTV collect data.

Data is pushed out (only via cell traffic) once every second, to be picked up by other nodes and propagated as necessary.

Data is secured by keys. Sniffing 10 packet (10s of data) and you've cracked it each network.

If cameras catch your identity, that gets propagated up to enemy servers. Once there they dispatch goons to come kill you.

Any data can be intercepted or deleted in transit. Nodes can be shut down I necessary, or chAnneled to your phone. For example, chnnel CCTV to your phone to look inside buildings, or outside your visible range.

Enemies who see you also broadcast information via headsets. If that gets to other agents, they join in. Server dispatches only a single hit sqaud.

Items can obscure identity so you can't be detected by cameras.

Gunshots trigger police intervention. Tactic is to lure agents to attack you where you know there is police surveillance so they get criminal tags and are hunted too.

Same applies for you - kill and become a criminal.

Map is city, but opens up to labs, bases, etc. just basic to start with.

A few built in story missions that need skills or money to start.

Subgames randomly generated - shut down this, find this person, hack that device, frame this person.

Other win atate: killer is marked as criminal and hunted down and killed. Justice.

Ability to call a device (phone, headset) and flood with data, causing stun for 10s.

Ability to call device and kill.

Call device and get nearby devices (chaining)

Call device and lift money from account.

Different devices take longer to break into. Higher your skill goes, or maybe better your phone is, faster you can break in.

Don't talk. I don't know how you survived that bullshit but here we are. This phone isn't safe. Dump it and meet at Illyad Park. Avoid the cameras - remember, you're dead.

Skill to spot camera fields.

Get to drop. Phone is ringing until you pick it up.

Npc only add side missions, variety. Skip initially.

Chaining can't intercept packets or break encryption - you need to have the key stores for that.

Noticing no updated from a node for a period (ie heartbeat) will dispatch someone to investigate and fix.
